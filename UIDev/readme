# GraphEvo

CHARACTERIZING AND UNDERSTANDING SOFTWARE EVOLUTION USING CALL GRAPHS
Understanding software evolution is an imperative prerequisite for software related activities such as testing,debugging, and maintenance. As a software system evolves, itincreases in size and complexity, introducing new challengesof understating the inner system interactions and subsequently hinders the overall system comprehension. While tools that construct and visualize call graphs have been used to facilitatesoftware comprehension, they are still limited to capturing the functionality of a single software system at a time. However, understanding the similarities and differences across multiple releases becomes an imperative and challenging task duringsoftware evolution. To this end, we present a tool, namedGraphEvo, that focuses onautomating the process of quantifying and visualizing the changes across multiple releases of a software system based on an information-theoretic approach to comparethe call graphs. Specifically, GraphEvo can automatically construct and visualize the call graph for one or more software releases, calculate and display a set of graph-based metrics, and construct color-coded call graphs to visualize system evolution. The main goal of GraphEvo is to assistsoftware developers and testers in exploring and trackingsoftware changes over time. We demonstrate the functionality ofGraphEvo by analyzing and studying five real software systemsthroughout their entire lifespan.
